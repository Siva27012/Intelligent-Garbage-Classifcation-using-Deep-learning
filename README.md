# Intelligent Garbage Classifcation using Deep learning
According to the next 25 years, the less developed countries’ waste accumulation will increase drastically. With the increase in the number of industries in the urban area,the disposal of the solid waste is really becoming a big problem, and the solid waste includes paper, wood, plastic, metal, glass etc. The common way of managing waste is burning waste and this method can cause air pollution and some hazardous materials from the waste spread into the air which can cause cancer. Hence it is necessary to recycle the waste to protect the environment and human beings’ health, and we need to separate the waste into different components which can be recycled using different ways.

The present way of separating waste/garbage is the hand-picking method, whereby someone is employed to separate out the different objects/materials. The person who separates waste, is prone to diseases due to the harmful substances in the garbage. With this in mind, it motivated us to develop an automated system which is able to sort the waste. and this system can take a short time to sort the waste, and it will be more accurate in sorting than the manual way. With the system in place, the beneficial separated waste can still be recycled and converted to energy and fuel for the growth of the economy. The system that is developed for the separation of the accumulated waste is based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network
